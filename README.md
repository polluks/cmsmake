**CMS Make**

This is CMS Make, a 'make' workalike for VM/CMS systems.

# cmsmake

CMS Make provides similar function on CMS systems
as traditional 'make' provides on POSIX systems.
Rules files are visually compatible with standard makefiles,
except that the Tab character can be ordinary white space.

This is a really really simple implementation.
The purpose is to allow a subset of 'make' functionality
which can be used interchangably between CMS and Unix/Linux/POSIX.

Several commands which work like their Unix/Linux/POSIX counterparts
are included in order to facilitate rules files which work the same
between CMS Make and POSIX/Unix 'make'.
